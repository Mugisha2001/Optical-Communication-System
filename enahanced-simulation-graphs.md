1. Transmitted Signal
Graph: A continuous waveform representing the OOK-modulated signal.
Interpretation:
This is the signal generated by the transmitter before it enters the optical channel.
The amplitude of the signal corresponds to logical 1s and 0s.
2. Noisy Signal After Transmission
Graph: A plot showing the signal after attenuation, amplification, and added noise.
Interpretation:
Attenuation by the fiber reduces the signal's power, but the optical amplifier boosts it.
Noise added to the signal represents real-world impairments like thermal noise or amplifier noise.

3. Eye Diagram
Graph: An eye diagram of the noisy signal after transmission.
Interpretation:
Compared to the baseline system, the enhanced systemâ€™s eye diagram may show a more open eye due to higher SNR after amplification.
The "eye height" indicates the margin for error in threshold detection. A larger eye height means better signal integrity.
