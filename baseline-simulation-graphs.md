 Transmitted Data
Graph: A stem plot showing the binary data transmitted (1s and 0s).
Interpretation: This represents the original random binary sequence generated by the transmitter. Each stem indicates a single bit, with "1" and "0" shown at their respective amplitudes.
2. Noisy Signal at Receiver
Graph: A plot of the received optical signal, showing amplitude variations over time.
Interpretation:
This signal has been attenuated by the optical fiber and further degraded by noise.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) impacts the clarity of the signal. Higher noise levels can obscure the distinction between logical 1 and 0.
3. Demodulated Signal
Graph: A stem plot of the signal after threshold-based demodulation.
Interpretation:
The receiver uses a threshold to decide whether each sample corresponds to "1" or "0".
Errors may occur where noise distorts the signal, leading to incorrect bit detection.

Eye Diagram
Graph: Overlapping segments of the noisy signal, creating a characteristic "eye" shape.
Interpretation:
The clarity of the "eye" opening indicates the signal quality.
A wide-open eye suggests minimal inter-symbol interference (ISI) and good SNR.
A closed or distorted eye implies significant signal degradation.

Output Power After Fiber
This reflects the signal power at the receiver after attenuation in the optical fiber.
The low value (0.1 mW) demonstrates significant power loss over the 50 km fiber.
Pulse Width after Dispersion: 20 ps
Dispersion in the fiber causes the optical pulse to spread in time, increasing its width.
A broader pulse leads to inter-symbol interference (ISI), making it harder to distinguish between adjacent bits.
Bit Error Rate (BER)
The BER indicates the proportion of bits received incorrectly.
A BER of 0.05 means 5% of transmitted bits were erroneous, mainly due to attenuation, noise, and ISI.
